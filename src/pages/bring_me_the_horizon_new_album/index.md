# BRING ME THE HORIZON(BMTH) - New Album

![](https://i0.wp.com/www.metalinjection.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Bring-Me-The-Horizon-Amo-Album-Review.jpg?fit=700%2C700)

Hello! This post is not about tech or something like that. (I mean, not about Programming or deep learning)

I suggest you guys to listen bring me the horizon's new album!

The album's name is AMO.

I am not a huge fan of them. So I exactly don't understand about their music 100%. (I am a huge fan of muse).
But, I have listened their music sometimes. (Not often , just sometimes).
I remember their music was a metal (not a real heavy metal but, I thought their music was metal) with some heavy riffs and growling vox.
But, I listened their new album recently, a song called mother tongue.
I think their music is crossing-over to pop(?).

But sounds good.

I am a big fan of one of their song called DROWN.

I think DROWN is a very well-made song. (maybe just for me).

A Starting part of the drown feels not metally, but I really like pre-chorus part (when vox is louder and growling..)

Anyway I suggest you guys to listen to BMTH!
